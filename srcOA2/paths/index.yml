## All route registered in a single index file. Should this file be getting very long, think about breaking your API up into smaller service aka microservice architecture

# General routes to search and create items
/weather/:
  get:
    $ref: ./v1/weather/get.yml
  post:
    $ref: ./v1/weather/post.yml

# Item specific routes, note the prefix /id/{id}
/weather/id/{id}:
  get:
    $ref: ./v1/weather/id/get.yml
  put:
    $ref: ./v1/weather/id/put.yml

# As the above {id} is nested inside /id, we can now introduce another weather uri segment
/weather/latest:
  get:
    $ref: ./v1/weather/latest/get.yml
